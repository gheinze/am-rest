== REST Security

User authentication is delegated to a third party OAuth2 identity providers
such as Google or Github. Once authenticated, the server provides the client with a
Signed JSON Web Token (JWS). The client includes this JWS with each subsequent
call to a secured REST endpoint.

The server checks for the existence of a valid token in the `Authorization` header
on each REST endpoint request. User identity and authorized roles are extracted
directly from the validated token. This information is used to determine whether
access is permitted to the secured endpoint. The server maintains no state regarding
whitelisted or blacklisted tokens. Instead, the server relies on:

* secure transport of the JWS (use HTTPS)
* secure handling of the JWS on the client (ex cookie)
* periodic JWS expiry (forcing the client to re-authenticate for a new token)

The application has two distinct process flows:

. acquisition of the JWS which relies on HTTP redirects and user input and hence cannot be treated as a REST endpoint
. REST API calls using the acquired JWS


== Authentication

Authentication is implemented using the OAuth 2.0 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4[authorization code grant] protocol.
The server relies on third party identity providers such as Google and Github. If the end user consents, the third party identity
provider is also used as resource server for retrieving personal details such as name and email address.

The following is an example of the OAuth2 authorization code grant message flow with two extra steps:

* retrieving user information for the authenticated user
* returning a JWS to the authenticated user

=== Registering with an Identity Provider

The application must register with the third party identity provider before the provider will accept
requests for authorization codes and authorization tokens for the applications. Registering involves the creation of a:

* `clientId` to identify the application (similar to a username, but for the application)
* `clientSecret` the "password" to be used with the `clientId`
* `scope` to identify the set of resources the application requests permission to access
* a list of allowable domains from which the application may request authorization tokens
* a callback uri which the identity server will send back to the client as a redirect when returning the authorization code

==== Google Identity Provider

The https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2[Google Identity Platform documentation]
provides an overview of how to use Google as an identity provider.

Credentials are created through the https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?project=asi-data[Google Developers Console].
First the appropriate project should be created or selected from the drop-down in the top-left corner:

image::amRestBackEndDoc/GoogleDeveloperConsoleProjectSelection.png[]

For this code sample, a new project was created named `a4-am` with a generated id of `a4-am-155202`. From within the project,
the following steps were taken to a new set of credentials for the application:

* click `Create credentials`
* choose `OAuth Client Id` for the type of credential to create
* select `Web Application` as the application type
** enter a name to identify the client application that will be using this credential (`a4-am-client`)
** authorized origins: origins from which the application may make requests for authorization tokens (for testing `http://localhost:8080`)
** authorized redirect uris: the redirect uri Google sends back to the client after authorization. The client can then call the
redirect uri (i.e. the application server) with an authorization code which the application server can use to retrieve an access token.
An example uri: `http://localhost:8080/login/google/oauth2Callback`

=== Configuring OAuth2 Provider Endpoints on the AppServer

Once the authorization provider has been configured to accept requests from an application server,
the application server must be informed on how to connect to the authorization provider. Most of
this configuration is stored in the `application.yml` file:

.AppServer Configuration properties for OAuth2 Authorization Providers
[source,yml]
----
security:
    oauth2:

        google:
            client:
                #clientId: configured externally
                #clientSecret: configured externally
                userAuthorizationUri: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth # <1>
                accessTokenUri: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token # <2>
                clientAuthenticationScheme: query
                scope: email,profile
            resource:
                userInfoUri: https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v2/userinfo # <3>

        github:
            client:
                #clientId: configured externally
                #clientSecret: configured externally
                userAuthorizationUri: https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize
                accessTokenUri: https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token
                clientAuthenticationScheme: form
            resource:
                userInfoUri: https://api.github.com/user
----

<1> the `userAuthorizationUri` is the uri of the identity provider that the client will be redirected
to in order to request an authorization code. When the client redirects, it will receive an authorization
code upon authentication and be redirected back to the application server

<2> the `accessTokenUri` is the identity provider uri which the application server will contact
with an authorization code in order to receive an authorization token. The request for a token
requires the application's `clientId` and `clientSecret` to identify the application along with the
`authCode` provided by the client.

<3> the uri the application can query for user information from the authorization server (acting as a resource server)

Note that `clientId` and `clientSecret` are confidential pieces of information and are not stored with the source code.
Instead, these properties can be configured externally.  For example:

  SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON={
      "security.oauth2.google.client.clientId": "myClientId"
     ,"security.oauth2.google.client.clientSecret": "myClientSecret"
   }

=== Login Endpoint (`login/{provider}`)

OAuth2 libraries (such as `spring-security-oath2`) are not used for handling the OAuth2 communications
for authentication. Instead a redirect url is crafted based on configuration and Spring `RestTemplate`
is used for requesting the auth token and for requesting user information. The `login/{provider}` is
the endpoint for initiating the authentication process.

The `login/{provider}/oauth2callback` endpoint is the url configured on the authorization provider as the
handler for receiving the auth code that the authorization server will generate. This is the endpoint that
will request the token using the authcode, use the token to request user information, and generate
a JWS to represent the authenticated user.

The `spring-security-oath2` library was not used since it introduced a layer of complexity (unknown auto-configured
components, unknown/lightly documented library) for something that could be implemented relatively easily using an http client.
The application server also performs some non-standard behaviour such as looking up user information and
returning a JWT. However, since Spring Security is being used for authorization checks, revisiting the
potential use of `spring-security-oath2` is warranted.

==== Java Config

=== Usage

To authenticate, the client makes a call to the application server with the url selecting the identity provider to use:

* {{baseUrl}}/login/google
* {{baseUrl}}/login/facebook
* {{baseUrl}}/login/github

On a successful flow, a JWS will be returned.  This JWS should be included in the `Authorization` header parameter for all
subsequent REST calls to the server.

=== Authorization via First Principles

Basic authorization checks could be performed relatively simply without using Spring Security.
An initial version of the application used a `ServletFilter` to intercept every incoming request for
`api/**` endpoints.  If the filter could verify the integrity of the JWS, the user would be considered
authenticated and processing was allowed to proceed.

.Registering a ServletFilter
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class WebConfig {

    /**
     * Registers a filter to validate JWTs on any requests accessing /api endpoints.
     *
     * @param jwtService
     * @return
     */
    @Bean
    @Autowired
    public FilterRegistrationBean JwtVerificationFilter(JwtService jwtService) {
        FilterRegistrationBean filterRegistrationBean = new FilterRegistrationBean();
        filterRegistrationBean.setFilter(new JwtVerificationFilter(jwtService));
        filterRegistrationBean.addUrlPatterns("/api/*");
        return filterRegistrationBean;
    }

}
----

.ServletFilter checking the JWT
[source,java]
----
public class JwtVerificationFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {

    private final JwtService jwtService;


    public JwtVerificationFilter(JwtService jwtService) {
        this.jwtService = jwtService;
    }


    @Override
    protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest hsr, HttpServletResponse hsr1, FilterChain fc) throws ServletException, IOException {

        // pre-condition: uri.startsWith("/api"))  registered via FilterRegistrationBean

        String authHeader = hsr.getHeader("Authorization");
        jwtService.parseAuthorizationHeader(authHeader);

        // no authentication exception thrown: continue
        fc.doFilter(hsr, hsr1);
    }

}
----

The `userid` and `roles` of the "authenticated user" performing the request can be extracted directly from
the JWS. This could be compared against the configured roles assigned to the requested service endpoint
in order to determin authorization. If the method is assigned roles via an annotation, and the annotation proxies
the method to do a role check, then the behaviour starts looking very much like Spring Security.  Hence
the use of Spring Security, even though it brings in more detail than may have been initially desired.
